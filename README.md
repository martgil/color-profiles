Various collections of display color profiles.

### Description
This will let you use the color properties of a specific monitor and apply them to the one you're currently using.

### Why?
Every Monitor/Laptop manufacturer releases their product with a dedicated color profile for their product that our computer imported.
A color profile from a different manufacturer may have a better set of colors to use compared to the one we're using. By applying the 
same set of colors from these profiles to our computer, the monitor we're using may display better and brighter colors depending 
on your preferences.

### How to use it?
Go to your Monitor calibration settings and import the specific color profile you want to use.
